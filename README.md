📊 DiAlert - Diabetes Prediction System using Machine Learning
DiAlert is a machine learning-based web application designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes in a person based on health parameters. It uses the text based Diabetes dataset to train the model taken from Kaggle and provides an easy-to-use interface for predictions.

🛠️ Technologies Used
This project primarily uses Python for the backend logic, including training the machine learning model, processing user input, and making predictions. The scikit-learn library is used for implementing the machine learning algorithm, while Pandas and NumPy are used for data manipulation and preprocessing. The Flask framework is optionally used to create a lightweight API that connects the backend model with the frontend interface, enabling real-time predictions. On the frontend, HTML is used to build the structure of the user interface, and CSS is used for styling and layout. In some cases, JavaScript may be added to enhance interactivity on the client side.
